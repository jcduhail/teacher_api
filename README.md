# Node Teachers API

## Requirements
Node 14+

## Installation
npm install

npm start

API will respond on http://localhost:8001

## Contents

- Express Node JS Framework
- The MySQL database is a free online one already configurated so normally no need to change anything in the config

- User Story 1 :

-- If a student does not exists, it will be created and registered to the teacher

-- If the student exists, he will be registered if not already

- User Story 2 : The query is not perfect, should be improved probably using a UNION or a kind of INTERSECT, i didnt have time :(

- User Story 3 and 4 should do the job

- Also run out of time for unit tests

## Tested using Postman
